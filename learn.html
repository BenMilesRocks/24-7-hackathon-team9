                <h3>Abro (sexual and romantic)</h3>
                <p>
                  A word used to describe people who have a fluid sexual and/or
                  romantic orientation which changes over time, or the course of
                  their life. They may use different terms to describe
                  themselves over time.

                <h3>Ace</h3>
                <p>
                  An umbrella term used specifically to describe a lack of,
                  varying, or occasional experiences of sexual attraction. This
                  encompasses asexual people as well as those who identify as
                  demisexual and grey-sexual. Ace people who experience romantic
                  attraction or occasional sexual attraction might also use
                  terms such as gay, bi, lesbian, straight and queer in
                  conjunction with asexual to describe the direction of their
                  romantic or sexual attraction.

                <h3>Allo (sexual and romantic)</h3>
                <p>
                  Allo people experience sexual and romantic attraction, and do
                  not identify as on the ace or aro spectrum. Allo is to ace and
                  aro spectrum identities, as straight is to LGB+ spectrum
                  identities. It is important to use words that equalise
                  experience, otherwise the opposite to ace and aro becomes
                  ‘normal’ which is stigmatising.

                  An umbrella term used specifically to describe a lack of,
                  varying, or occasional experiences of romantic attraction.
                  This encompasses aromantic people as well as those who
                  identify as demiromantic and grey-romantic. Aro people who
                  experience sexual attraction or occasional romantic attraction
                  might also use terms such as gay, bi, lesbian, straight and
                  queer in conjunction with asexual to describe the direction of
                  their attraction.

                  A person who does not experience romantic attraction. Some
                  aromantic people experience sexual attraction, while others do
                  not. Aromantic people who experience sexual attraction or
                  occasional romantic attraction might also use terms such as

              <h2>History</h2>
              <p>
                The history of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
                transgender) community is rich with significant events and
                milestones that have shaped its current landscape. Here is a
                brief overview:
              </p>
              <h3>Ancient and Early History</h3>
              <h4>Ancient Civilizations</h4>
              <p>
                Homosexuality was documented in ancient civilizations, including
                Greece, Rome, Egypt, and China. In many of these societies,
                same-sex relationships were accepted or even celebrated.
              </p>
              <h4>Middle Ages</h4>
              <p>
                Attitudes towards homosexuality became more negative with the
                rise of Christianity in Europe. Sodomy laws were enacted, and
                homosexual behavior was often punished severely.
              </p>
              <h3>19th and Early 20th Century</h3>
              <h4>1869</h4>
              <p>
                The term "homosexuality" was coined by Karl-Maria Kertbeny, an
                Austrian-Hungarian journalist, marking the beginning of modern
                discussions on sexual orientation.
              </p>
              <h4>1897</h4>
              <p>
                The Scientific-Humanitarian Committee was founded in Germany by
                Magnus Hirschfeld, advocating for homosexual rights and the
                decriminalization of homosexuality.
              </p>

              <h3>Mid-20th Century</h3>

              <h4>1950</h4>
              <p>
                The Mattachine Society, one of the first LGBT organizations in
                the United States, was founded by Harry Hay.
              </p>
              <h4>1952</h4>
              <p>
                The American Psychiatric Association (APA) classified
                homosexuality as a mental disorder in its Diagnostic and
                Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).
              </p>

              <h3>1960s and 1970s</h3>

              <h4>1969</h4>
              <p>
                The Stonewall Riots in New York City marked a turning point in
                the LGBT rights movement. Following a police raid on the
                Stonewall Inn, a gay bar, members of the LGBT community fought
                back, leading to several days of protests.
              </p>
              <h4>1970</h4>
              <p>
                The first Gay Pride marches were held in New York, Los Angeles,
                and Chicago to commemorate the Stonewall Riots.
              </p>
              <h4>1973</h4>
              <p>
                The APA removed homosexuality from the DSM, declassifying it as
                a mental disorder.
              </p>

              <h3>1980s and 1990s</h3>

              <h4>1981</h4>
              <p>
                The AIDS epidemic began, disproportionately affecting the gay
                community. This crisis spurred activism and awareness.
              </p>
              <h4>1987</h4>
              <p>
                ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) was founded to advocate
                for people with AIDS and demand action from the government.
              </p>
              <h4>1993</h4>
              <p>
                "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" was implemented in the U.S. military,
                allowing gay and bisexual people to serve as long as they did
                not disclose their sexual orientation.
              </p>

              <h3>21st Century</h3>

              <h4>2003</h4>
              <p>
                The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Lawrence v. Texas that sodomy
                laws were unconstitutional, effectively decriminalizing
                homosexual acts in the United States.
              </p>
              <h4>2010</h4>
              <p>
                "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" was repealed, allowing LGBT individuals
                to serve openly in the U.S. military.
              </p>
              <h4>2015</h4>
              <p>
                The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that
                same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, legalizing it
                nationwide.
              </p>
              <h4>2020</h4>
              <p>
                The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County that
                the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees from
                discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
              </p>

              <h3>Recent Developments</h3>

              <h4>2021-Present</h4>
              <p>
                There has been a growing recognition of non-binary and
                transgender rights, with increased visibility and advocacy for
                these communities. Legislative battles continue over issues such
                as transgender rights, conversion therapy bans, and
                discrimination protections.
              </p>

              <p>
                The LGBT movement has evolved from early struggles for
                decriminalization to broader fights for equal rights and
                societal acceptance. Each milestone has built upon the last,
                pushing the movement towards greater visibility and equality.
